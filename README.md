### Hello! My name is Nicole Nguyen. I am a third year Informatics Major at the University of California, Irvine.

I am currently learning Python, but I look forward to learning more about other programming softwares such as Java. I am still looking into different specializations within informatics and plan on working on some projects in the near future to explore my potential interests.
